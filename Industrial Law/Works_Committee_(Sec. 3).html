            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To comment upon matters of common interest between employers and workmen, with a view to promote
measures for securing and preserving amity and good relations between them; and

                </li>
                <li>
                    To endeavour to compose any material difference of opinion in respect of such matters of common interest or

                    Part 7 (rr 38 to 57) of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules 1957, has made elaborate provisions for
                    the Constitution of works committees, election of representatives of workmen, their term of office, dissolution of such
                    committees, etc. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In case, there is a registered trade union operating in the industrial establishment, in addition to compliance with the requirements of rr 38 to 57, representatives of the workmen shall have to be chosen in consultation
with the trade union. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    These rules do not contemplate nomination of representatives of workmen in any situation and circumstance whatsoever.
                </li>
                <Li>
                    Rule 38 requires an employer, to whom an order made under s 3(1) of the Act relates, to constitute a works committee in the
prescribed manner.
                </Li>
                <li>
                    Rule 39 contemplates that the total members constituting a works committee shall not exceed 20 and further that the number of representatives of the workmen shall not be less than the representatives of the employer. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nomination of the representatives of the employer is contemplated by r 40. Equally clear is the fact that the representatives
                    of the workmen are to be always elected. The manner of this election may vary but there has to be an election.
